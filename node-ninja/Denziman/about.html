    <h1>Princess Denzi</h1>
    <p>
        3,000 years in the past, planet Denzi was a highly advanced and extremely beautiful world,
         where all people were happy and successful. However this all changed when the Vader Clan 
         emerged in the dimension and released a monster known as Umitsular; the monster corrupted 
         all of the water on the planet, making it unsafe to drink and destroy and corrode all that 
         it touches. In order to combat the Vader Clan's monster, the people of planet Denzi worked 
         on creating a secret weapon to combat the being which would ultimately be known as the mecha 
         DaiDenzin; but the actions of Umitsular lead to the planet's destruction before it could be deployed. 
         With no other options, the scientists send the secret base where DaiDenzin was created to another world, 
         with the Denzi Computer and Denzi Dog IC to protect it and guide whomever ended up with the technology. 
         The landmass ultimately ended up on Earth where it would become Denzi Land and be used by five youths 
         recruited three thousand years later as Denziman to fight against the Vader Clan threat once again.

    <h2>ESPers</h2>
    <p>Those who are descendant to the Denzi are known to possess supernatural abilities, 
        generally through a powerful ESP that, if powerful enough, can become felt by 
        Queen Hedrian and cause her immense pain.
